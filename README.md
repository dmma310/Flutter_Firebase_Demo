Implement Wasteagram, a mobile app that enables coffee shop employees to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created. The application also displays a list of all previous posts, which are stored in Firebase Firestore.

In addition, uses Firebase Auth to authenticate and verify users for role-based displays, and shared preferences to update theme.
